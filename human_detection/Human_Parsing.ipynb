    "## Detection criteria\n",
    "1. More than 5% of pixels are classified as human labels\n",
    "2. There are more than one detected human labels\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance on 100 images\n",
    "- Accuracy: 85%. Total time used: 3 min \n",
    "- Fail reasons:\n",
    "    - Most of the human body is covered by cloths: Image 73, 85, 141, 144, 151, 185, 203, 251, 258, 283, 757\n",
    "    - Human figure is too small: Image 23, 24\n",
    "    - Other weird scenarios: Image 96 (cannot recognize part of the arm); Image 102 (sport bra classified as human face)\n",
    "- **Pros**\n",
    "  - Easy to compute and understand, the pixel-wise logit is a by-product when going through the human-parsing phase in the BMI estimation model\n",
    "- **Cons**\n",
    "  1. Impractical, need to save the logits (~100MB for large image) of each image to disk, which consumes huge space when the number of images is huge\n",
    "  2. The pixel is related to actual size. So if the area of human figure is of small size compared to the image size, the threshold fails in such case\n",
    "  3. When most of the human body is covered by cloths, only small percentage of pixels are classified as human body. This method fails in such case. As the class labels of \"atr\" human dataset also contain some clothing labels - 'Hat', 'Upper-clothes', 'Skirt', 'Pants', 'Dress', 'Belt','Left-shoe', 'Right-shoe', 'Bag', 'Scarf', it is a trade-off to include these labels and improve recall, or to exclude these labels to improve precision.\n",
    "  4. Only a rule-based method, might not be generalized to all cases\n",
    "  5. The pixel threshold cannot guarantee that the part detected as human is clustered at a place, because pixel can be anywhere in the image, which is not meaningful in some cases"
